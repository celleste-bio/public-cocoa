# Integrated Analysis and Optimization of Cocoa Cultivation: Enhancing Quality, Productivity, and Sustainability

The project is about investigating the behavior of different varieties of cocoa trees in both cultivation fields and laboratory settings. The primary goal is to analyze and understand the factors influencing the behavior of cultured cocoa cells and their products, aiming to improve the quality and productivity of yields while enhancing growth rates. Additionally, the study includes a laboratory-focused analysis, disconnected from field conditions, to identify optimal scenarios for cultivation. Advanced data analysis, including the examination of climate conditions, cocoa characteristics, and genomic data, will be conducted to build models that reveal relationships and trends. The ultimate objectives involve achieving precision in laboratory growth conditions for cocoa butter production and developing models that contribute positively to the global challenge of declining cocoa trees and rising cocoa prices due to environmental degradation and viral impacts.
